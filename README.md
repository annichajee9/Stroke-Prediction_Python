# Stroke-Prediction_Python
This is my final project which is part of DAT301 at Arizona State University
This is a project written by Python programming language

Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning – This project analyzed medical data to identify key risk factors for stroke using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. Key findings revealed that hypertension, high glucose levels, and BMI above 30 were strong indicators of stroke risk. Various machine learning models were implemented to predict stroke likelihood, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and statistical analysis​.
